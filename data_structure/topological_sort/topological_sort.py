# Time and Space Complexity
# Determine the indegree for each node. This is O(M) time (where M is the number of edges),
# since this involves looking at each directed edge in the graph once.
# Find nodes with no incoming edges.
# This is a simple loop through all the nodes with some number of constant-time appends.
# O(N) time (where N is the number of nodes).
#
# Add nodes until we run out of nodes with no incoming edges. This loop could run once for every nodeâ€”
# O(N) times. In the body, we:
# Do two constant-time operations on a list to add a node to the topological ordering.
# Decrement the indegree for each neighbor of the node we added. Over the entire algorithm, we'll end up doing exactly one decrement for each edge, making this step
# O(M) time overall.

# All together the time complexity is O(M+N)
# Space complexity: O(N)
